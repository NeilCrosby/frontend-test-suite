# Frontend Test Suite

This repository will contain my suite of classes and gubbins for allowing automated testing of frontends.  The test suite will initially cover HTML validity, CSS validity and JSLinting for "good" code.  Later the suite will allow you to do more interesting things.


None of this will work yet.  I'm pulling together what I've done on other projects, standardising and make it all work together.  Right now I've just whumphed everything together.  Give me a few days and things will actually start doing things.
