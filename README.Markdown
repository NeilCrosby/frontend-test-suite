# Frontend Test Suite

This repository will contain my suite of classes and gubbins for allowing automated testing of frontends.  The test suite will initially cover HTML validity, CSS validity and JSLinting for "good" code.  Later the suite will allow you to do more interesting things.

The HtmlValidator class now works, and will validate both chunks of HTML and full HTML documents, which is nice.
